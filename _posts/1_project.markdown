While studying at UC Berkeley, I had the opportunity to work with [Blue Goji](https://www.bluegoji.com/). They had developed an assistive Mechanical Treadmill to improve mobility functions of the seniors through engaging them in interactive games. My team worked on building data models to quantify the gait and motion of the users of the treadmill using data collected from sensors integrated on the treadmill.

We shared our findings and journey with the UC Berkeley Engineering community and members of the public in May 2019, and I built a simple website to summarize and document what we had done. The initial template of the website was forked from HTML5UP.

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project-infinity.jpg">
