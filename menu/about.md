title: who's brewing?

I am currently based in the Bay Area in a [healthcare startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cogitativo-inc-/){:target="\_blank"} that focuses on positively impacting the delivery of healthcare through data science methods. I graduated from University College London with BEng Mechanical Engineering, and subsequently read MEng Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at UC Berkeley.

Central to the academic topics I'm interested in is the idea of optimisation. Once, while as a student of Mechanical Engineering, I was fascinated by structural optimization problems with stress, displacement, natural frequencies, etc as the design constraints. I delved deeper into such design optimization problems in my Final-Year project, working to reduce the displacement a fabric chimney supporting with load while not exceeding design constraints in any of its members. I soon observed parallels in many other disciplines, which was a huge reason I decided to pursue Operations Research later.

I'm intensely passionate about the few things I am interested in, and so this webpage is a culmination of some of my weekend projects. When I'm not at my laptop, I can be found [clicking away on my camera](https://limclara-sq.github.io){:target="\_blank"}, or being engrossed in a good book. I love a good conversation; feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:limclara.sq@gmail.com){:target="\_blank"} here!
